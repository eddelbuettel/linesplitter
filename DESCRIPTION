Description: The nanoarrow package offers C-level functionality to work with Arrow objects,
 along with a small amount of C++ integration. Its documentation contains a C++ example of a
 line splitting routine filling an Arrow array. This package provides a minimal wrapper from R.
 It currently contains Rcpp bindings for convenience which could be removed to make it a C API
 example bindings package. The package contains code from the 'nanoarrow' package and its
 documentation.
